# Deep Learning For Computer Vision

Welcome to the **Deep Learning for Computer Vision** repository! This repository contains comprehensive tutorials, practice examples, and projects for learning and implementing deep learning techniques in computer vision.

## 📚 Overview

This repository provides hands-on implementations of various computer vision tasks using deep learning frameworks (primarily PyTorch). It's designed for students, researchers, and practitioners who want to learn and practice computer vision techniques.

## 🎯 Features

- **Image Classification**: Implementations using CNN architectures (ResNet, VGG, etc.)
- **Object Detection**: Examples with popular detection models
- **Image Segmentation**: Semantic and instance segmentation implementations
- **Data Utilities**: Helper functions for loading and preprocessing images
- **Training Scripts**: Ready-to-use training and evaluation pipelines
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive tutorials for learning

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- CUDA-compatible GPU (optional, but recommended for faster training)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahmoudmoe84/Deep-Learning-For-Computer-Vision.git
cd Deep-Learning-For-Computer-Vision
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
